### SDF Prediction using Physics Informed Neural Operators

Created a Physics Informed Neural Network to predict Signed Distance Function values for an arbitrary polygon. The networks expects the polygon boundaries as input. The network has been implemented in Jax.

```sh
python operator_learning.py
